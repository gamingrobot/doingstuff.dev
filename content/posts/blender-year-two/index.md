Last year was spent learning the basics of Blender and how to make photorealistic renders. This year was spent trying to bend EEVEE and the compositor to make stylized renders.

## Invisible Man

Created a small animation from a still image and a single rendered frame of the monster to learn more about compositing.

## Hacking Device (EEVEE)

I recreated my [Hacking Device ](https://gamingrobot.art/artwork/hacking-device)in EEVEE but still used [Malt](https://malt3d.com/) for the line art.

## Cutaway Attempts

I was struggling to get my NPR shaders from the Hacking Device render to work well on interior scenes. These were my attempts at doing cutaways as an alternative. I want to revisit this technique later because I really enjoy cutaways.

## Chroma Corp

These were inspired by some of the [Chroma Corps](https://www.chroma-corps.com/) prompts. The harvesting machine is unfinished, but I like how the shading turned out.

## Milling Machine

This is the Milling Machine I modeled last year combined with the NPR shaders from the Hacking Device into a full animation.

## NPR Shader Tests

These are shader tests with the NPR shaders I refined when making the milling machine render. I really wanted to see how they worked for materials with normals, interiors, and area lights. As part of these, I modified Malt into my own line art addon, [Cider](https://github.com/gamingrobot/Cider).

## Holiday Penguin

This was created in the "1 hour challenge" in the [Ctrl+Art+Del Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Vj8ceHJ3Ee).

## Giant Hand

Blockout I started for a large-scale environment.

## Space Shop

More progress on my machine shop render with my NPR shaders and line art.

## Ink Sketching (Not-Blender)

Since I started learning art by trying to draw, I decided to try again by taking an [Ink Sketching course](https://www.learnsquared.com/courses/ink-sketching-fundamentals). (I am only partway through the course)

{{ img(src="ink_sketches.webp", alt="collage of ink sketches, a skull, a barn, three mountains, a windmill" link="") }}


## Next Year
Next year will be spent finishing existing projects and learning more about sketching so I can try out ideas before going into Blender.
