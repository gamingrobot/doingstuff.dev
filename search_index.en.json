the video.\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nSoftware🔗\n\nRendered in Blender 4.5 using EEVEE\nLine art is rendered using Malt/Cider\nGrain was generated using Grainy\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Update 2025: I used smear lines instead of motion blur using AutoSmear.\n\n\nLight and Shadow🔗\nTo get sharp shadows, I set the Shadow Step Count to 1 in Render -&gt; Shadows. Then set these settings on lights in Light Settings -&gt; Shadows:\n\nEnable Jitter with 10% Overblur\nFilter to 0.0\nResolution Limit to 0.0001m\n\nTo disable background light emission, I disconnected the Background from the output in the World shader (or by setting the Strength to 0.0). This allows control of the exact color of the objects and shadows in the material shader.\nSpot Lamp🔗\nThere is a spot lamp inside the mill's lamp illuminating the mill and the volumetric.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nSun Lamp🔗\nThe low-power sun lamp has a copy rotation constraint targeting the camera and has shadows disabled. This light also uses light linking to exclude some items from the light due to weird shading.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nSince it is a low-powered light, it only gives highlights to areas outside the main spot lamp.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nMaterials🔗\nI set the Color Management to Standard and added a Shader AOV for Bloom (Color) in the View Layer settings. The bloom is a separate AOV because everything in the scene is emissive, and I only want bloom on specific objects. A Cryptomatte Object pass would also work for this.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nThese are the nodes for the DiffuseColor node group. The ColorOffset value changes how dark the shadows/diffuse shading are (faking the background illumination without changing the main shader color).\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nVolumetrics🔗\nThe lamp volumetrics are set up on a separate view layer with the spot lamp, so the volumetric did not affect the lighting of the main scene. The mill was set to Holdout, so it didn't render the volumetric where the mill was.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nParticles🔗\nThese are the settings I used for the swarf particle system. The swarf models were in a collection that was randomly selected. I had difficulty with getting the physics to be stable, so I set the scene gravity to half, set collision on the metal block, and baked the simulation before rendering.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nLine Art🔗\nI tried a couple of different approaches for the line art.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    LineArt Modifier\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    FreeStyle\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Malt\n  \n  \n\n\nSince I really liked how Malt's line art looked, I decided to go with that one. Malt is a custom render engine, so I had to use a linked scene since each scene can only have one render engine selected.\nI used the default line width settings and set the Color to transparent. In the main Default Render node tree, I also set the background to transparent.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nAfter this project I created Cider, which uses Malt but renders the line art alongside the main render so it can be used in compositing. It also makes it easier to set line art styles directly in the material settings and has support for a viewport preview. Cider is meant for just line art on top of an EEVEE or Cycles render, so Malt should still be used for more complex line art.\nCompositing🔗\n\n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video.\n\nFor compositing, I enabled transparency in Render -&gt; Film -&gt; Transparent since I had disabled the background in the World shader earlier. Then I can then composite in any color as the background.\nI enabled additional passes in the View Layer settings:\n\nZ/Depth (for Vector Blur)\nVector (for Vector Blur)\nCryptomatte Object (to mask out specific objects for Vector Blur)\n\nI had a weird issue with one frame in the middle of the render having a large vector change to the metal block in the vector pass but not in the combined pass. So I used the Cryptomatte Object pass to mask out the cutter to apply the Vector Blur to.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nThe settings I used for generating the grain with the Grainy addon:\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nIf you liked this, you can find more of my art at gamingrobot.art.\n","date":"2025-11-02T00:00:00Z","id":"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/blender-milling-machine-breakdown/","title":"Blender - Milling Machine Breakdown"},"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/blender-year-one/":{"body":"\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nMy day job is as a Software Engineer, and until last year I also spent my free time coding various side projects. But I started experiencing burnout and felt anxious every time I tried to work on a project. This was very uncomfortable because it felt like I couldn't express my creativity anymore, so I started looking at non-code ways to be creative.\nI tried learning drawing and doing genuary in vvvv. But as part of a M8 visualizer I was making in vvvv, I had to tweak a 3D model in Blender. I had used Blender before, making the donut, messing with physics, but never felt like I knew how to use it.\nSo now it's been a little over a year since I started, and here are all the half-finished, false starts, the overambitious projects, and the finished art I did this year.\nRobot Head🔗\nThis was the first thing I made, and I was just noodling around trying to make a robot head with camera lens eyes and a dot-matrix mouth. The materials are from Sanctus and the welds were made using an addon.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nPen Effect🔗\nWhen I was trying to learn drawing, I really liked how blue-black ink looked and wanted to see if I could replicate the same pen look in Blender.\n\n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video.\n\nSchiit Fulla🔗\nI saw a recommendation to try modeling an item you have physically so you can look at it from all angles. So I recreated my Schiit Fulla based off a product photo. Recreating a photo was a great way to learn a bunch of different things in one project. I learned modeling, how to match lighting, and how to make basic procedural materials. I also learned how to use f-spy to match the original camera.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nHigh Voltage Plug🔗\nSince the last project didn't use Subdivision Surface (SubD) modeling, I wanted to try another photo recreation that would require using SubD.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nBuried Robot🔗\nSince I now felt I had a good handle on the basics, I decided to try and make an animation. I didn't end up finishing this one because I was using Ian Hubert's robot arm until I made my own (and I am still working on that).\n\n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video.\n\nTorn Leaf🔗\nThis was a fun project for TodePond's torn leaf gallery. It was neat to do something that just looked cool and didn't need to be realistic.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nMechanical Hand Rigging🔗\nI wanted to try to learn rigging, so this project was to learn how to do Inverse Kinematics and Forward Kinematics in the same rig.\n\n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video.\n\nThis finger is based on Ian Davis' hand design. For the rig, I was figuring out how to do bone constraints to create secondary movement.\n\n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video.\n\nSpaceships🔗\nThis was another attempt at making an animation. I spent a bunch of time trying to make the earth with moving clouds and then struggled with how to model the ships themselves.\n\n    \n    Your browser doesn't support the video.\n\nPliers🔗\nI recreated mbt3d's pliers to learn more complicated SubD modeling and how to make procedural wear on materials.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nMachined material🔗\nI wanted to make some materials that resembled machined metal for the next project.

Packages have their own version information, so we don't need to embed one in the library.\nWhat about the ABI version?🔗\nABI version can be separate from your product/release version. If you haven't changed the ABI interface, you can keep the same ABI version while updating the product/release version on new builds. There are some great resources, policy, and tools for how to handle ABI versioning.\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Symbol versioning is another way to handle ABI changes without changing the ABI version, this blog post is all about symbol versioning.\n\n\nWays of embedding version information🔗\nOkay, so you want to embed a version in your ELF shared libraries. How should you do it?\nSCCS String🔗\nProbably the easiest to add, this method uses the Source Code Control System @(#) convention to embed the version.\n\nThen the version can be retrieved via what(1) or strings libfoo.so | grep \"@(#)\"\n\nThis is human-readable but slow since it has to look at all the strings in the binary. If you want to get the version programmatically, we have another method.\nELF Note Header🔗\nThis method creates an ELF note header by defining a note struct with the descriptor field. Then uses __attribute__((used, section(...), aligned(4))) to tell the compiler to add the ELF header.\n\n\nNote sections contain a series of notes. Each note is followed by the name field (whose length is defined in namesz) then by the descriptor field (whose length is defined in descsz) and whose starting address has a 4 byte alignment. Neither field is defined in the note struct due to their arbitrary lengths.\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    More details in the elf manpage under the Notes (Nhdr) section.\n\n\nThen readelf -Wn or an ELF parsing library can read the version header.\n\nThe downside is the output is in hex when using readelf, unlike the human-readable format of SCCS above. But this method is faster since it's only reading the ELF headers rather than the whole binary.\nCan executables use these methods?🔗\nYup, if you need to provide a version without executing. But the more intuitive solution is to have a --version argument.\n","date":"2023-03-22T00:00:00Z","id":"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/elf-shared-library-version/","title":"Embedding Version Info into ELF Shared Libraries"},"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/floating-point-hell/":{"body":"This blog post will show how to deal with floating-point error in JavaScript by encoding all uint64's, and int64's as strings in JSON Marshaling.\n\nJavaScript has 53-bits of integer precision, this is a problem when trying to represent a 64-bit number.

This one will cover how I handle configuration management.\n\nPart 1: The Adventure Begins\nPart 2: Configuration Management (You are here!)\nPart 3: Internal Network\nSidequest: Switching from Salt to Ansible\nPart 4: Application Hosting and Monitoring\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Since this blog post was written I have switched from Salt to Ansible.\n\n\nWhat is Salt🔗\n\nSalt is a configuration management and orchestration tool.\n\nWhat this means is it allows me to declare a \"state\" that the infrastructure should be in. It also allows me to run commands/modules across the infrastructure. Some alternatives to Salt are Ansible, Chef, Puppet.\nHow I am using Salt🔗\nSalt is the base of my infrastructure, once a server is installed Salt then provisions the rest it.\nThe idea is anything not in docker is configured by Salt. That way when a server needs to be reinstalled or added, I know configuration isn't missing due to manual changes.\nFolder Structure🔗\nThis is a view of my Salt configuration git repo, some files/directories are missing from this view for the sake of readability. It is useful to see an example of how other people have laid out their Salt configuration when setting up your own.\n\nSalt🔗\n_module/_states🔗\nThese are custom modules and states that are synced to minions. I will cover the custom zerotier module/state in another blog post.\nApp🔗\nThese are states that require the installation of a package. The configuration of the application also lives here.\nConfig🔗\nThese are states that are pure configuration and nothing new is installed.\nContainer🔗\nThese are docker containers that are either going to be on every server (watchtower) or are required to bootstrap other containers (portainer).\nTrait🔗\nSalt has many ways for targeting states to a machine in the top.sls file. The top.sls file is what Salt looks at when you run highstate for what states should be applied to a minion.\nThe Salt community has this idea of using grains to apply roles to a server called Role-based infrastructure. This works if the server has a specific role like database or webserver.\nTraits are a similar idea but are more targeted at what you need on the server and are more fine-grained than database or webserver.\nThis setup allows me to have a very small initial highstate and then apply traits as I need them for specific servers.\ndefault-packages.sls🔗\nThis is a list of helpful packages that are installed by default on all minions.\n\ntop.sls🔗\nThis is the file looked at when highstate is run. As you can see I have a very simple base that gets installed by default and then everything else is defined by traits.\n\nPillar🔗\nThis is where the any machine specific configuration and sensitive data lives.\nI store both my Salt states and pillar data in the same git repository so I can test and update configurations. Any secrets in the pillars are PGP encrypted using Salt's gpg renderer. Salt supports many pillar sources and they can even be used in combination.\ntop.sls🔗\nThis is the pillar top file which defines what minions have access to specific pillar data.\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Grains are controlled by the minion, so a server can access pillar data for other traits due to matching on grains.\n\n\nMaximum Saltiness🔗\nI hope this gave you a good view of how I use Salt to configure my servers. In the next part we will cover how to have an internal network over the internet.\nPart 1: The Adventure Begins\nPart 2: Configuration Management (You are here!)\nPart 3: Internal Network\nSidequest: Switching from Salt to Ansible\nPart 4: Application Hosting and Monitoring\n","date":"2020-02-06T00:00:00Z","id":"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/homelab-adventure-part-2/","title":"Homelab Adventure - Part 2: Configuration Management"},"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/homelab-adventure-part-3/":{"body":"Welcome to my journey in building my Homelab. This is part of a multipart series; in the last part I gave an overview of how to set up configuration management. This one will cover how I set up my internal network.\n\nPart 1: The Adventure Begins\nPart 2: Configuration Management\nPart 3: Internal Network (You are here!)\nSidequest: Switching from Salt to Ansible\nPart 4: Application Hosting and Monitoring\nWhy?🔗\nIt's helpful to have an internal and external network for your Homelab. This allows hosting of internal services without exposing them to the internet.\nSince my Homelab lives in multiple datacenters (and at home), it's less convenient to use a site-to-site VPN. So a peer-to-peer VPN between all my servers is ideal. This also makes it easy for me to add non-servers to the network like my phone or desktop to access those internal services.\nWhat is ZeroTier🔗\n\nZeroTier is a distributed network hypervisor built atop a cryptographically secure global peer to peer network. It provides advanced network virtualization and management capabilities on par with an enterprise SDN switch, but across both local and wide area networks and connecting almost any kind of app or device.\n\nThis means ZeroTier is \"mostly\" a peer-to-peer VPN, what I mean by \"mostly\" is that it still uses a \"centralized\" network controller (you can host your own if you want). The bulk of the traffic is peer-to-peer, and the network controller is only for the initial routing. This has some trade-offs with something that is entirely peer-to-peer.\nAlternatives🔗\nThese are some other options for peer-to-peer VPNs:\ntinc is one of the oldest peer-to-peer VPN's, but to set it up you have to share the generated public keys for each node with all the other nodes you want to connect.\nNebula (inspired by tinc) has similar issues to tinc with certificate distribution. One advantage over tinc is that a discovery server is present in the Nebula network to ease node discovery.\nTailscale while a great alternative to ZeroTier, it didn't exist at the time I set up ZeroTier. This is a great comparison between Tailscale and ZeroTier.\nZeroTier and Salt🔗\nI have written a salt formula for managing ZeroTier with salt. It allows interacting with the local agent and the network controller's API.\nhttps://github.com/gamingrobot/salt-formula-zerotier\n","date":"2023-03-29T00:00:00Z","id":"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/homelab-adventure-part-3/","title":"Homelab Adventure - Part 3: Internal Network"},"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/homelab-adventure-part-4/":{"body":"Welcome to my journey in building my Homelab. This is part of a multipart series; in the last part I showed how to set up an internal network across multiple hosts. This \"final\" post will go over application hosting and monitoring.\n\nPart 1: The Adventure Begins\nPart 2: Configuration Management\nPart 3: Internal Network\nSidequest: Switching from Salt to Ansible\nPart 4: Application Hosting and Monitoring (You are here!)\nApplication Hosting🔗\nAll applications are hosted in Docker and configured by Ansible and kept updated via Watchtower. I decided to go with this route instead of Kubernetes because:\n\nI don't have shared storage across all servers\nI don't need multiple instances of the applications\nMost applications are on specific servers\n\nEach container gets a separate role in Ansible that creates a storage folder, a user, and the container. Then in the main playbook I can specify which roles apply to which hosts or the whole group.\n\nExposing applications🔗\nI use Traefik to expose each application based on labels. I use a wildcard certificate to enable HTTPS, but Let's Encrypt could also be used. If you are worried about mounting the docker.sock directly to Traefik, you can set up socket-proxy.\n\n\nThis config sets up the certificates and a middleware for HTTPS redirection and an ipAllowList. This middleware can then be specified on a container via the traefik.http.routers.&lt;app_name&gt;.middlewares: 'internal-network@file' label (replace &lt;app_name&gt; with the application name).\n\nThis config sets up the entrypoints, HTTPS redirection and the Docker provider.\n\nNow any container with the traefik.enable: 'true' will be automatically exposed on &lt;container_name&gt;.&lt;traefik_domain&gt;. If traefik.http.routers.&lt;app_name&gt;.middlewares: 'internal-network@file' is set as a label, the application will only be accessible from IPs on the ipAllowList.\nFor managing DNS, I use DNSControl so I can version control my DNS configuration. Ansible could also be used, but it's more verbose.\nMonitoring🔗\nFor general server metrics and monitoring, I use Netdata. There are some additional monitoring modules I have set up:\n\nSMART monitoring\nUPS monitoring\nContainer metrics\n\nThis gives alerts for things like high disk usage, high memory usage, UPS failed over to battery, and SMART failures.\nFor custom monitoring, I use Uptime Kuma. It works well for application health monitoring as well as custom webhook monitors. I have set up custom webhook monitors for:\n\nBTRFS Health\nBTRFS Scrubbing\nBackups\n\nI have alerts from both Netdata and Uptime Kuma going to Pushover and email.\nPart 1: The Adventure Begins\nPart 2: Configuration Management\nPart 3: Internal Network\nSidequest: Switching from Salt to Ansible\nPart 4: Application Hosting and Monitoring (You are here!)\n","date":"2025-07-13T00:00:00Z","id":"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/homelab-adventure-part-4/","title":"Homelab Adventure - Part 4: Application Hosting and Monitoring"},"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/homelab-switching-salt-to-ansible/":{"body":"About a month ago I thought it would be nice to be able to configure VM's and Droplets with Salt by using my existing configuration I had set up in Part 2: Configuration Management.\n\nI could have gone the normal route of installing the Salt minion and attaching it to the Salt master then running the highstate. But since these would be resource constrained machines I had concerns about the resource usage of the minion.\nSo I decided to try Salt SSH, which uses ssh to transfer a lightweight minion that executes the states and then exits. It would also allow me to to use Salt from my local machine instead of remoting into the server hosting the Salt master.\nThis worked great until I attempted to run it and hit this lovely bug where if you are using gpg-encrypted pillars the minion will attempt to decrypt them rather than decrypting locally and when rendering the state.\nThis wasn't the first time I had run into a nasty Salt bug, this bug caused watchtower to break and I had to rollback to a previous version.\nGiving Ansible a try🔗\nI read Jeff Geerling's Ansible for DevOps book, which gave a really good overview of Ansible and how I could map what I knew from Salt to Ansible. I also looked for blog posts of people migrating from Salt to Ansible, but almost all of them were company blogs talking about how they outgrew Ansible and migrated to Salt.\nI ported some of my simpler states to Ansible to try and get a feel for how my Salt traits and states mapped to Ansible playbooks and roles.\nThese are the Ansible concepts explained in terms of Salt:\n\nPlaybook\n\nAnsible playbooks are the mapping between host and roles/tasks.\nSalt's top file is also a mapping between hosts to states.\n\n\nRole\n\nAnsible roles contain tasks, files, variables and handlers.\nSalt formulas contain states, files and variables.\n\n\nVariables\n\nAnsible has two types of vars group_varsand host_vars. group_vars are scoped to the group in the inventory while host_vars are scoped to a specific host.\nSalt pillars contain the variables specific to a host. Pillars can contain gpg encrypted values for Ansible it encrypts the whole yaml via ansible-vault.\n\n\nHandlers\n\nAnsible handlers are tasks but are triggered via notify, these most closely map to Salt Reactors. But are primarily used to achieve the same result that Salt's on_change does to have states that trigger off other states changing.\n\n\nInventory\n\nAnsible needs to know what hosts its going to be connecting to.\nSalt's master keeps track of the connected minions and in Salt SSH it uses a roster.\n\n\nGalaxy\n\nAnsible Galaxy is a repository of roles created by the community.\nSalt's version of this is the saltstack-formulas repos.\n\n\n\nAfter porting 1000 lines of yaml🔗\nAfter porting all my Salt states to Ansible there were a few things that tripped me up.\nSalt allows for jinja templating inside state files, instead Ansible only allows jinja templating inside yaml values and template files. This affects how loops are done, in Salt they are handled with a jinja for loop, but in Ansible you use a loop and loop_control in the yaml.\nSalt🔗\n\nAnsible🔗\n\nWith Salt you can specify the source of a local file via salt://{{ tpldir }}. In Ansible when specifying a local file it will first look in a role's files folder.\nSalt🔗\n\nAnsible🔗\n\nSalt has targeting as part of the state.apply command, in Ansible you can limit the scope of the playbook by using --limit\n\nLiving with Ansible for a few months🔗\nThings I liked🔗\nI really like that when you hit Ctrl+C during execution Ansible stops the playbook execution. This is nice when I have forgotten to make a change or something failed on one host but not another. With Salt you get a job id that you have to cancel manually or let it finish.\nBecause I am running Ansible locally, iteration time is quicker. In Salt I am committing then pushing my changes, pulling them down on the master and running highstate.\nDocumentation is considerably better for Ansible. The documentation pages include multiple examples for a module. Since many other homelabbers run Ansible there are many blog posts and examples on how to do something.\nAnsible Vault is much easier to use than gpg encrypting pillar data. By default it encrypts entire files but you can encrypt specific values like Salt's gpg pillars.\nThings I disliked🔗\nThe roles folder structure is verbose but only requires the folders you use.\nThe largest complaint I saw about Ansible was how slow it was compared to Salt. I saw speeds similar to Salt with this additional configuration:\n\n","date":"2024-03-20T00:00:00Z","id":"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/homelab-switching-salt-to-ansible/","title":"Homelab Sidequest - Switching from Salt to Ansible"},"https://doingstuff.dev/posts/reaper-midi-unreal-engine/":{"body":"How to setup Reaper to send MIDI to Unreal Engine.\n\n    \n        \n    \n    If you are looking to use OSC instead, take a look at daw-out.\n\n\nSetting up Reaper🔗\n\n\nInstall loopMIDI (This allows us to create a loopback MIDI device)\n\n\nAdd a new MIDI device in loopMIDI called unreal_port\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nEnable new MIDI output in Reaper via Options -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Audio -&gt; MIDI Devices\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Only enable the MIDI Output\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nSetup MIDI output routing per track via:\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Routing Matrix (View -&gt; Routing Matrix)\n  \n  \n\n\nOR\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n    Track routing settings (IO button on track)\n  \n  \n\n\n\nSet each track to a separate MIDI channel, so each track number maps to its corresponding channel number.\nSetting up Unreal Engine🔗\nBased on this forum thread\n\n\nEnable MIDI Device Support Plugin\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nImport Midi Blueprints\n\n\nCreate Blueprint Interface with OnNoteAction and OffNoteAction functions called MidiListener\n\n\nSet Game Instance Class via Edit -&gt; Project Settings -&gt; Maps &amp; Modes -&gt; Game Instance -&gt; Game Instance Class\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\nSet MidiDeviceId in MidiManager to map to the output of unreal_port (You can find this out from the debug logs in the console)\n\n\nPlace MidiDebug in the scene to print note debug information to the console\n\n\nPlace TestListener in the scene and set MidiChannel to whichever track # in Reaper\n\n\nTest it out🔗\nIf you have added MIDI to the track, set the MidiInput number and MidiChannel number on the TestListener.

I decided to use Sunshine/Moonlight due to latency issues with Steam Remote Play.\nFedora KDE Desktop uses Wayland, which adds some complexity when trying to match the Steam Deck resolution and refresh rate. Since the Steam Deck is using a 16:10 aspect ratio (1280x800), when streaming from a 16:9 display, there will be black bars on the top and bottom of the screen.\nWith X11 you can use xrandr (wlroots based Wayland compositors can use wlr-randr) to specify a custom resolution and refresh rate (display mode). Under KDE with Wayland, kscreen-doctor only supports setting the display mode to one that is supported by the display. We can get around this by using a custom EDID, either with a dummy display dongle or using drm.edid_firmware to specify a custom EDID.\nSetup Sunshine and Moonlight🔗\nI set up Sunshine using the Fedora COPR. Then I set up Moonlight on my Steam Deck following this guide.\nTesting Normal Streaming🔗\nConfirm everything is working normally by streaming to the Steam Deck and seeing the 16:9 aspect ratio.\nCustom EDID🔗\n\n    \n        \n    \n    Custom EDIDs should be safe, but I'm not responsible for your hardware.\n\n\n\nPlug the monitor into a Windows machine and use Custom Resolution Utility.
